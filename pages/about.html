  <p>Hello! I'm Matt, and I'd like to tell you a bit about me.</p>
  <p>I'm a high school student who likes technology and coding different things. In fact, my favorite
  programming language (so far) is Javascript. Although many would disagree, I feel it is quite the
  useful and flexible language. However, I yearn to learn Python at some point, and next school year
  I take a Java class.</p>
  <p>Oh! I also enjoy testing different Linux distrobutions, my favorite so far
  being Ubuntu Budgie for the clean, decluttered look and feel it has. It has a few bugs, however
  those will probably be ironed out overtime.</p>
  <p>Another thing (yes, I know) I enjoy is photography. I don't have a great camera,
  an Olympus E-520 (4:3 Ratio), however it's much better than any phone camera you can find.
  I hope to gain enough money at some point to get one of the newer Canon DSLRs (I'm not a fan
  of the mirrorless stuff..yet).</p>
  <p>Other than that, I stride to gain a Comp Sci degree, perhaps in another country than the US.
  I quite dislike the US (at least it's not the worst place) and hope to migrate to either Sweden
  or Germany (both would be great, but Sweden has great views! Oh, the photos I could take)</p>
